# Introducing CutiePy

I am excited to announce the first official release of CutiePy, v0.1.0!

***Disclaimer: CutiePy v0.1.0 is not ready for use in production.***

CutiePy is an open source job scheduler for Python. The goal of CutiePy is to provide a better experience for developers who currently run background jobs with cron or Celery.

CutiePy v0.1.0 contains the most basic functionality to enqueue jobs, create scheduled jobs, and create recurring jobs.

In the future, CutiePy v1.0 will define a stable API and specification of CutiePy's behavior. By v1.0, CutiePy will be ready for use in production.

If you are so bold, you can check out the [**Quickstart guide**](/docs/quickstart) to try out CutiePy now.
