# About CutiePy

Welcome to CutiePy! This page contains background information about the CutiePy project.

## What is CutiePy?

CutiePy is an **open source job scheduler for Python**. CutiePy allows you to:

* **enqueue a job** to run immediately
* **create scheduled jobs** that will run once at a later time
* **create recurring jobs** that will run periodically at a fixed interval, like a [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) job.

CutiePy ships with a **real-time monitoring dashboard** to help you track your jobs and workers.

## Who created CutiePy?

CutiePy was created by me, **Bobby Chen**!

**I am a software developer who loves building developer tools.**

I first fell in love with programming in middle school, when I learned to customize gameplay for Minecraft and Garry's Mod.
Over the years, I have worked as a software engineer at [**Airbnb**](https://airbnb.com/), [**Intel**](https://www.intel.com/), [**DataCamp**](https://www.datacamp.com/), and [**Dagster**](https://dagster.io/).
My work has involved building internal tools for managing web infrastructure, Kubernetes, and data pipelines.

**I make tools that I want to use myself, and I'm excited for you to try CutiePy!**

I created CutiePy for my colleagues, my friends, and the wider Python community.
CutiePy was originally designed to help manage background jobs in our Django and Flask applications, such as making asynchronous API requests to email providers, connecting to Slack/Discord endpoints, and sending webhooks.
Beyond web applications, CutiePy is also used in research for parallelizing data pipelines, ML experiments, and other long-running Python workloads.

## How is CutiePy licensed?

CutiePy is open source, released under the [**Apache-2.0 license**](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0).

My entire career has been built on the shoulders of generous software developers who release their code with permissive licenses.
People have helped me.
I want to carry it forward.
You are welcome to use CutiePy for hobby projects and commercial purposes.

The source code of CutiePy is available in the official GitHub repository [**chenbobby/cutiepy**](https://github.com/chenbobby/cutiepy).

## How can I contribute to CutiePy?

CutiePy is currently not open to contribution.
I need some time to think about copyright for outside contributions.
I will also need to write a Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA).
Until then, CutiePy will be closed to contributions.

If you still want to provide feedback to CutiePy, please open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/chenbobby/cutiepy/discussions) for public feedback, or email me at [chenbobby@fastmail.com](mailto:chenbobby@fastmail.com] for private feedback.
